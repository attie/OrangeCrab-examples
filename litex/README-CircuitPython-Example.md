# OrangeCrab DDR3 SoC CircuitPython demo

``` Currently under-development ``` 

> Note there is currently a potential Yosys bug that effects building LiteX SoCs. Please use an earlier build of yosys (Before Jul 1st). You can also find prebuilt binaries on the prebuilt branch: https://github.com/gregdavill/OrangeCrab-examples/blob/prebuilt/litex


## Setup Instructions
Before building the LiteX SoC, you must install a suitable toolchain, for example GCC.
Download a package from [sifive.com/software](https://www.sifive.com/software), extract it, and add it to your path.
The example below will install GCC v8.3.0 on an Ubuntu system.

```console
$ curl -LO "https://static.dev.sifive.com/dev-tools/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0-2020.04.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14.tar.gz"
$ tar -xvf riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0-2020.04.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14.tar.gz
$ export PATH="$(readlink -f ./riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0-2020.04.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/bin):${PATH}"
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -v
```

It is also necessary to install the `pythondata-software-compiler_rt` python package, as follows:

```console
$ pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/litex-hub/pythondata-software-compiler_rt.git
```

## Build Instructions
> Add \``--revision 0.1`\` argument when running this to build for the r0.1 board
```console
$ python3 SoC-CircuitPython.py
 ```

If this is the first time running this command it will pull in submodules of LiteX and all the dependancies requiled to build. Then this will invoke LiteX/Migen to generate verilog and fed it to yosys/nextpnr to generate a bitstream for the ECP5.

When the synthesis is complete you will find the gateware to be loaded at `"build/orangecrab/gateware/orangecrab.bit"`

## Compile CircuitPython
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/gregdavill/circuitpython.git -b orangecrab
$ cd circuitpython 
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ cd ports/litex
$ make BOARD=orangecrab
```

## Combine SoC and Circuit Python firmware and flash
Copy `circuitpython/ports/litex/build-orangecrab/firmware.bin` into this directory, and use this command to create a combined binary.
This step creates a single binary that will fit our code at `0x80000`, and CircuitPython riscv code at `0x100000` in FLASH after we've loaded it through the DFU bootloader.
 ```console
$ python combine.py
$ dfu-util -D combine.dfu
 ```

## CircuitPython is now running!

The SoC will take a few seconds to start up, but if you run dmesg, you should see a new ttyACM0 attached, as well as a Mass storage device
```console

Connecting to the ttyACM0 device you should see the following
```console
$ screen /dev/ttyACM0
Auto-reload is on. Simply save files over USB to run them or enter REPL to disable.

Press any key to enter the REPL. Use CTRL-D to reload.
